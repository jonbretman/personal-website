Why is writing so hard? It isn't for lack of things to write about and it isn't for lack of time. Something about staring at an empty text editor and a blinking cursor renders the brain incapable of turning thoughts into words no matter how much time you devote to the act. If you can somehow manage to successfully convert some of your thoughts into words then more often than not you realise that the words don't come together to make a coherent sentence. The ability to create many coherent sentences and arrange them in such a way that they convey the thoughts you had in your brain is surely pure voodoo.

But maybe the issue isn't with the words or sentences, but with the thoughts in your brain. Maybe those thoughts aren't quite as well formed or structured as you thought they were and as a result can't be written down any more than you can take a photo of the wind. To be able to write thoughts down we need to confront them, untangle them, and understand them. We also need to separate the useful and interesting thoughts, where we learn new things things or make observations about the world around us, from the noisy and self-destructive ones (we all know which ones those are). It's obviously possible to do this and _not_ write anything down, but writing is clearly a good way of finding out how well you understand your thoughts. I have never been very good at writing down my thoughts. I have tried at various times in my life to keep a journal or write blog posts but never managed to get into any kind of rhythm with it. One reason for this might be that I'm not very good at confronting my own thoughts. As it turns out confronting my thoughts is something I have been forced to do over the last year or so.

As a child my mum always told me I "moved too fast". My parter regularly has to tell me I have gone into "fast-forward" mode, normally when I'm excited about something. I have always worked too much, put in too many hours, always feeling like if I just do that little bit more something _good_ will happen. And the problem is that it felt like the good things did happen. The extra hours and always doing that bit extra meant I got noticed, got promoted, got rewarded. So I kept doing it. I continued this approach for fifteen years and then in March 2020 the pandemic hit. At the time I was the CTO of Echo, an online pharmacy, and like many companies that offered a delivery service demand went through the roof. I was working seven days a week, eleven hours a day, doing everything I could to help us keep up with the growth. By July I was completely burnt-out. I took a week off work to "recover" but just went right back at it. In October I passed out in the bathroom, badly cutting my lip as I fell against the sink. My partner found me collapsed in the hallway. I had been drinking pretty heavily that night, and that probably contributed, but it was likely the earliest sign of the cancer growing in my body. Six months later I was diagnosed.

I remember getting the call from the doctor who told me without much ceremony "you have Hodgkins Lymphoma" followed by the slightly comical "but if you were to get any cancer you'd want to get this one, it's very treatable". I remember feeling calm and accepting of this utterly awful news. I told my partner in a very matter of fact way and then called my parents. "Wow, I'm handling this so well" I thought. I was told by the team treating me at St. Bartholomew's that it was advisable to see a counsellor or therapist, and so I started having weekly therapy sessions. It wasn't until the second or third session, after I'd had my first chemotherapy treatment, that the calm and "in control" Jon melted away to reveal an utterly-emotionally-overwhelmed Jon. The tears came, in floods and floods, and they kept coming. I suddenly realised how incredibly angry I was. How sad and defeated I felt. It wasn't just the cancer. It was the pandemic, lockdown, the wedding that got cancelled, the stress of my work, my relationship with my parents. A whole lifetime of thoughts that had until this point just lived in my head started to get said out loud and I came to realise how noisy and chaotic my mind was. I started to take mindfulness seriously, read books on the topic, actively practiced, and slowly (very slowly) could start to see when my thoughts were spiralling. I leaned to _be with_ my thoughts. I slowed down.

And so here I am, just over a year later, still being treated for this horrid disease. The next phase is a stem cell transplant, which I have been warned will be particularly unpleasant and will require an extended stay in hospital followed by a long recovery time at home, but if all goes well this will be the last treatment I will need. The most recent round of chemotherapy I had seems to have worked well and my last scans were all clear, so I'm going into it with good odds. But life likes to throw shit at you, so who knows. What I do know is that I'm slowly learning to stop spending so much energy thinking about the future, about work, about what might happen, what could happen, and instead trying to be more present in the moment. Because although I could tell you how the last few years have been just awful and there is still more awfulness to come, I could also tell you about the house we've renovated and how happy we are to be living across the road from Epping Forest where we go for walks daily. I could tell you about the business I've co-founded with two wonderful people and the amazing team we've hired and the incredibly exciting product we're building. I could tell you how I've been getting more into cooking, that I've been practicing the piano every day, and that I'm writing songs I'm really proud of. There is so much to be thankful for and to celebrate. There is also pain and suffering. Welcome to life.
